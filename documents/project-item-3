Microservices Deployment Platform | React, Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, AWS EKS, Terraform, Prometheus
January 2023 – May 2023

CI/CD Automation: Built end-to-end Jenkins pipeline integrated with GitHub Actions, automating testing (Jest/Cypress), containerization (Docker), and deployment to Kubernetes clusters. Reduced deployment time by 70% and eliminated 15+ hours/week of manual operations.

Cloud-Native Orchestration: Deployed 50+ microservices on AWS EKS using Helm charts, implementing auto-scaling, service meshes (Istio), and persistent storage (EBS). Achieved 99.99% uptime with zero-downtime blue/green deployments.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managed cloud resources via Terraform modules (AWS VPC, IAM, S3) and Kubernetes operators, reducing environment provisioning from 8 hours to 15 minutes. Enforced GitOps practices using ArgoCD.

Observability & Security: Implemented centralized monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki) with custom dashboards tracking 200+ metrics. Integrated OPA policies and Trivy vulnerability scanning into CI pipeline, blocking 50+ high-risk deployments.

Developer Experience: Created self-service portal (React) for environment management, reducing onboarding time from 5 days to 2 hours. Standardized development workflows across 12 teams.

Key Outcomes:
✓ Cut cloud costs by 35% via resource optimization and spot instance utilization
✓ Accelerated release frequency from bi-weekly to daily deployments
✓ Reduced critical incident resolution time by 60% with real-time alerting
✓ Enabled compliance with SOC 2 through auditable deployment workflows
